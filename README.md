# hello-world
Hey guys, 
My name is Dustin, I'm 22 years old and I want to get started with coding and maths. 
For far too long I have let my former teachers and people around me tell me that I am not made for math even though it is my passion and biggest interest.
After contemplating and maturing, I finally decided to prepare for changing my current major and study CS in the ETH, there are still some hurdles (entry exam) that I have to overcome but I'm determined to succeed.
I will document my preparation process here in GitHub and and at a later point even record YouTube videos of my journey.
